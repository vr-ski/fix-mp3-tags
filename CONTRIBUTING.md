# 🤝 Contributing to FixMP3Tags

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, testing with different MP3 files, or adding features — your help is welcome and appreciated.

---

## 📦 Project Scope

FixMP3Tags is a command-line tool for fixing and normalizing MP3 ID3 tags. It aims to be:

- Lightweight and dependency-minimal (core Perl + essential MP3 modules)
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows with Perl)
- Safe and non-destructive (always backs up original files)
- Flexible with user-defined patterns and rules

---

## 🧰 How to Contribute

### 🐛 Report Bugs
- Search [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/fix-mp3-tags/issues) first to avoid duplicates
- Include:
  - OS and Perl version (`perl -v`)
  - MP3 file examples (if possible)
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Error messages or unexpected behavior

### ✨ Suggest Features
- Open an issue with a clear description
- Explain the use case and why it's valuable
- Bonus: suggest how it could be implemented

### 🛠️ Submit Code
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`feature/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Submit a pull request with a clear summary

### 📚 Improve Docs
- Typos, formatting, or clarity improvements are always welcome
- You can edit `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or add new docs
- Help improve POD documentation in the modules

### 🎵 Test with Different MP3 Files
- Test with various MP3 encodings and ID3 tag versions
- Report compatibility issues
- Share test files (if possible) or detailed descriptions

## 🧪 Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fix-mp3-tags.git
cd fix-mp3-tags

# Install dependencies
cpanm --installdeps .

# Run tests
make test

# Or directly with prove
prove -l t/

# Test the script
perl -Ilib bin/fix-mp3-tags --help
```

For development with a local Perl environment:

```bash
# Using perlbrew (recommended)
perlbrew install perl-5.36.0
perlbrew switch perl-5.36.0

# Using plenv
plenv install 5.36.0
plenv global 5.36.0
```

## 🧼 Code Style

This project uses:

- **Perl Best Practices**: Follows Perl::Critic standards (see `.perlcriticrc`)
- **Automatic Formatting**: Uses `perltidy` (see `.perltidyrc`)
- **Code Quality**: Enforced with pre-commit hooks (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

### Before submitting:
```bash
# Format code
perltidy lib/**/*.pm bin/fix-mp3-tags

# Check code quality
perlcritic lib/**/*.pm bin/fix-mp3-tags

# Run tests
make test

# Or run specific tests
prove -lv t/01-processor.t
```

### Key Style Points:
- Use strict and warnings in all files
- Follow Perl Best Practices (Damian Conway)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Add POD documentation for new modules/methods
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests:
```bash
# Basic test suite
make test

# With verbose output
prove -lv t/

# Specific test file
prove -lv t/02-user-patterns.t

# Test coverage (if Devel::Cover installed)
cover -test
```

### Adding Tests:
- New features should include tests in `t/`
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use `Test::More` for new test files
- Consider edge cases with different MP3 formats

## 📦 Release Process

For maintainers:

1. Update `$VERSION` in `lib/FixMP3Tags/Processor.pm`
2. Update `Changes` file with release notes
3. Commit and tag: `git tag -a v0.02 -m "Release 0.02"`
4. Push tags: `git push --tags`
5. Create GitHub release (triggers CPAN upload)
